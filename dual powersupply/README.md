# Dual Power Supply Mounts

This is for mounting two power supplies to connect in serial for DC charging a Ecoflow Delta Pro.

The main three printed parts are psu_base, psu_brace, and cross_support.

The wago is from Thingiverse user joochung.  The link is include in the respository.

The assembly uses 3 cross support to connect 2 psu bases.  On the cross support by the connectors on the psu is where the wago gets added.  The psu brace goes between the two psu and mounts in the screw holes above the connectors.

Look in the images folder for a better idea on assembly.  I will try to update this in the future.

I printed in ASA with 40% infil.  Part are in the correct position to be printed.  No supports needed.
